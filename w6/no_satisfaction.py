# i can't get no satisfaction
# cos I try and I try and I try and I try

#  while I can't get no satisfaction... what can one do
#  cause I try and I try and I try and I try

# for loop or while loop?

# for loop is for when you know how many times you want to loop, right?
# while loop is for when you don't know how many times you want to loop

# while i'm riding round the world and i'm doing this and i'm signing that 🥁🎸👅

# write a while loop that prints out the lyrics to the song
# ask the user if they're satisfied
# only stop singing the song when the user is satisfied
